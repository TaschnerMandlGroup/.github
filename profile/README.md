## Welcome to the Taschner-Mandl Lab at Children's Cancer Research Institute (CCRI)
We are a group of experimental and computational biologists at CCRI with the goal to tackle unresolved questions of neuroblastoma pathogenesis and develop new diagnostic and therapeutic approaches to facilitate precision medicine for children with malignant tumors. For more information visit our [institutional homepage](https://ccri.at/research-group/sabine-taschner-mandl-group/).

This organization hosts analysis and software repositories supporting our research.

- [MapMetSC](https://github.com/TaschnerMandlGroup/MapMetSC): Single-cell analysis pipeline for data extracted from MapMetIP
- [ALT-FISH](https://github.com/TaschnerMandlGroup/ALT-FISH): Classification of ALT-FISH spots
- [AI4CAN](https://github.com/TaschnerMandlGroup/AI4CAN): App for FISH image classification
- [SpatialIMC](https://github.com/TaschnerMandlGroup/SpatialIMC): Spatial interaction analysis in IMC images

All repositories are currently in development and private, but will be published soon. Stay tuned.
